PostgreSQL data access layer in Python. The application was inspired by PHP library [NotORM](http://www.notorm.com/).

It includes functionality as:

* Simulation of materialized views
* Improvement plans for database structures based on benchmarks and database usage
* Smart querying of related records by listing ID's (similar as in NotORM)

The application was developed for my [Master thesis](http://theses.cz/id/sgb68f).
